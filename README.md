A brief introduction about myself 

I am **Soham Banerjee**, a Computer Science and engineering student at RCCIIT Kolkata. I have been a frontend developer and have been working for many organisations since the past 2 years. Have been an open source software enthusiast since I was introduced to it and, I am grateful to be a part of FOSSology under the GSOC programme 2022.  

In this article I am going to outline the details of my contributions as a reference of project completion during the entire duration of GSOC 2022.


# üåè CONTRIBUTIONS 

During this period i have been working on different modules of the project in the three categories:

- **UI IMPROVEMENT:**  Introducing refreshed UI pages in the application with their respective functionalities.

- **EXISITING FEATURE ENHANCEMENT:**  In this category we redefined old features and made them much more usable and user friendly.


- **BUILDING REST APIS:** We introduced many more features using API endpoints so that they can used in the UI

Let's Dive into the processes I implemented during this entire GSOC period. 
## All Recent Jobs Page

_(June 16th, 2022)_

Implementation of the All Recent Jobs page in the UI started.
The response from the `/jobs` endpoint was used in order to get the data from the backend server

Response format of the API: <br/>
![Screenshot from 2022-06-24 10-04-12](/img/reactUI/docs_api_res.png)

At first `MDBReact` datatable was used to render the data but further discussions on optimising the page the idea was scrapped and `X-Total-pages` header was used to get the data from the server in already paginated form.

Final UI of the All Recent jobs page after the discussions looks like: <br/>

![Screenshot from 2022-06-24 10-10-47](/img/reactUI/alljobs_ui_sample.png)

### üë®‚Äçüíª PR link - [feature(ui): /allRecentJobs page completed](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/223)

### My Recent Jobs Page

The same API endpoint was used in My Recent Jobs page and the logged in user's UID was fetched from the `getUserSelf()` function.
`MDBReact` table was used here and this requires change to the same UI as of `/allRecentJobs` page.

### üë®‚Äçüíª PR link - [feature(ui): /myRecentJobs page completed](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/228)

## Search in Browse Page

There was a search-bar present in the Browse page but, there was no function implented to make the search work. Thus introduced a search function which filters the API response as per the query data and only renders the value which is asked by the user.

**Pull Request** : [feat(UI): Import CSV-license file PAGE](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/259)

## Horizontal Pagination implementation

_(June 25th, 2022)_

Implementation of the horizontal page navigator. The pagination module fetches the data from the API on page basis thus reducing the response time of the API.

The All Recent Jobs page with the new Pagination module: <br/>
![pagination](/img/reactUI/pagination.png)

The Module also contains a text box so that user can directly navigate to that particular page at once.
This was suggested by one of the mentors and was implemented after.

### üë®‚Äçüíª PR link - [feat(ui): horizontal pagination added in allRecentJobs](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/235)

## /jobs API

Started modifying the /jobs API and currently making a demo docuentation so that the flow of the APIs can be made clear. The API was discussed in the meeting and mentor asked to implement it in a certain suitable way.

Current response of the API: <br/>
![jobs_res](/img/reactUI/jobs_res.png)

Mentors asked to take the user ID as a parameter and not in the URL itself. In addition to this there were suggested changes in the endpoint names and processes which are yet to be implemented.

## Horizontal Pagination implementation in browse page

_(July 3rd, 2022)_

Implementation of the horizontal page navigator in the browse page. The pagination module fetches the data from the API on page basis thus reducing the response time of the API in the browse page. This was implemented earlier in the allRecentJobs page.

The Browse page with the new Pagination module: <br/>
![pagination](/img/reactUI/browse_pagination.png)

### üë®‚Äçüíª PR link - [feat(ui): Pagination in Browse page](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/237)

## /jobs API

`/jobs` endpoint now sends only the jobs created by the logged in user. This API can be called by both the Admin and other users.

Fossy user Page: <br/>
![jobs_res](/img/reactUI/fossy_response.png)

Another user's Page: <br/>
![jobs_res](/img/reactUI/buggy_response.png)

Mentors asked to create an flag to get all the jobs irrespective of the user which will only be used by the Admin user.

## Jobs/all endpoint added 

_(July 14th, 2022)_

Implementation of the `jobs/all` API endpoint. this API endpoint sends all the jobs craeted by all the users. This API only sends a response only if the requesting user is an admin.

The API response when the requesting user is an Admin: <br/>
![adimin_res](/img/reactUI/admin_response.png)
<br/>

The API response when the requesting user is Not an Admin: <br/>
![nonAdmin_response](/img/reactUI/nonAdmin_response.png)

### üë®‚Äçüíª PR link - [feat(api): jobs/all endpoint added](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2260)

## New endpoint for geting copyright details

_(July 21th, 2022)_

Implementation of a new endpoint which gives the copyright information as a response for the requested upload.<br/>
It also provides the respective file paths for each copyright which is reccuring troughout the output.

The API response when requested on a upload (used Nirjas repository here): <br/>

## `uploads/<uploadID>/licenses` endpoint completed

_(August 14th, 2022)_

Working on the `uploads/<uploadID>/licenses` endpoint to return the latest clearing decision for each and every filepath completed this week.
Used `ItemTreeBounds` to get the latest clearing decisions. Rather than using the seperate SQL qureies and modifications in the DAO files created seperate functions so that they can be reused and the funcionality of the earlier funtctions in the DAO files remain the same.

Was able to return the latest clearing status for each upload ID and return it in the api response:

![api_res](/img/reactUI/api_clearing_decision.jpeg)

The new function created in `LicenseDao.php`:

```
public function getLicensesAndTreeIdPerFileNameForAgentId(ItemTreeBounds $itemTreeBounds,

## Documentation:üìÑ

During the GSoC period, I got the time to create and organize documentation for both the [**FOSSology UI**](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI) and FOSSology [**REST-API**](https://github.com/fossology/fossology). The documentation contains all the user and developer information of the project and is organized in a way to be easily accessible by all.

The weekly documentation of updates can be found at [**FOSSology/gsoc**](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2022/ui/updates/soham/2022-06-24)
